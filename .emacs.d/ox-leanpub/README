ox-leanpub.el

Org-mode backend to export Markdown for publication with Leanpub

Small adaptation of ox-md.el to make the exported markdown work better
for Leanpub (http://leanpub.com) publication.  It handles footnotes,
and makes source code separated from its output, and the output does
not display line numbers.  Html blocks are ignored.  Latex fragments
are formatted with {$$} {\$$}, and crosslinks work better than the
default (if you use IDs).

Take a look at http://juanreyero.com/open/ox-leanpub/index.html for
more details on how it works, limits and installation.
